# calisthantics-web

`calisthantics-web` is a self-contained web server

## Development

### Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Start dev server

```sh
$ npm start
```

This starts the development server which serves (in addition to the production routes)
content to `localhost:3006/` and `localhost:3006/mocks/`, allowing developers to quickly
view and develop 'mock screens' without needing to connect to the backend. To learn
more, visit the dev homepage at `localhost:3006/`.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages(Production)

```sh
$ npm run deploy
```

You should not be doing this unless given permission.
