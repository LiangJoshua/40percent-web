# calisthantics-web

`calisthantics-web` is a self-contained web server

## Development

```

### Start dev server

```

This starts the development server which serves (in addition to the production routes)
content to `localhost:3000/` and `localhost:3000/mocks/`, allowing developers to quickly
view and develop 'mock screens' without needing to connect to the backend. To learn
more, visit the dev homepage at `localhost:3000/`.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages(Production)
#### You should not be doing this unless given permission.

```
